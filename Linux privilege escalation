Linux priv esca techniques

1) Local Accounts
2) SUID & SUDO permission(binaries)
3) Kernal Exploit

1) Kernal Exploit
step 1:) check the version .. to copy the version to search in google find the exploit
cmd : cat /proc/version
Step 2) using linux exploit suggester.sh to check the kernal exploit information
download the file
give permission
run
cmd: ./linux exploit suggester.sh


2.1) SUDO
cmd:
sudo find . -exec /bin/sh \; -quit

2.2) SUID
Definition: SUID (Set owner User ID up on execution) is a special permission that allows other users run with the owner’s privileges. 
That’s why SUID files can be exploited to give adversaries the higher privilege in Linux/Unix system called privilege escalation. 
Mostly, root access is the goal of hackers when performing privilege escalation.

SUID will be set by adding number 4 in the permission number when using chmod command. 
For example: 4777, 4600, 4500, 4000, etc.

cmd: sudo chmod 4777 demo_file

Note: Letter s or S in the permission both represent for the SUID file. 
They only switch to one another when the execute permission is set.

Find the SUID files
The following command will list all of the SUID files in the system

find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
